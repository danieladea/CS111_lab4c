lab4c_tcp.c-
c file that builds and runs on a Beaglebone.
This is based on the temperature sensor application for lab4b (including the --period=, --scale= and --log= options).
accepts the following (mandatory) new parameters:
--id=9-digit-number
--host=name or address
--log=filename
port number
There is no --port= in front of the port number. This is a non-switch parameter.
It accepts the same commands and generates the same reports as the previous Beaglebone project, but now the input and output are from/to a network connection to a server.
It opens a TCP connection to the server at the specified address and port

as before,it  sends (and logs) newline terminated temperature reports over the connection
as before, processes (and logs) newline-terminated commands received over the connection
It does not accept commands from standard input, or send received commands or generated reports to standard output. 

lab4c_tls.c-
This is souorce code to
open a TLS connection to the server at the specified address and port
send (and log) your student ID followed by a newline
send (and log) temperature reports over the connection
process (and log) commands received over the connection
Usage is similar to lab4c_tcp
